Q1. There is no login api documented in the given documentation ? Do i need to implement that. Currently I am passing user-id in the param to access user specific data.
Q2. In swagger documentation, the register api has invite code and pins, but there's nothing about name etc. Is it fully anonymous


Changes : 
In follow api, only one id is being taken in slug (path param), but I have added two ids : i.e. Source and the target
There are many problems related to the parameters in the given documentation, so i have adjusted according to the feasibility.
